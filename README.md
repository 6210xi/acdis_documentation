# DOCUMENTATION FOR ACDIS  WEBSITE WITH MODX
Hey, I'm Peixian Wang, student developer for spring 2014. The ACDIS website is a dynamically generated website with ModX as the backend, and there was absolutely no documentation for the website when I came in, so I decided to write one. In theory, this should always be on my [github account](https://github.com/6210xi/acdis_documentation), with git source control. However, this might may not hold in the future, so I'll leave a copy of this inside the server. If you're approaching this with a scorched earth tactic, don't worry about this and wipe the content. 

#### How this is organized
I won't go into detail about how to use modx, you can find that information on the [modx site](http://rtfm.modx.com/). I will however, go into detail on individual changes I've made and things that you might need to use.
